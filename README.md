Installation to a single project
You can choose to install Talisman only in a single repository. Currently, only pre-push hooks are supported. If you want to install in more ways, consider installing as a Global Hook instead.

# Download the talisman binary
curl https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/install.sh > ~/install-talisman.sh
chmod +x ~/install-talisman.sh
# Install to a single project (as pre-push hook)
cd my-git-project
~/install-talisman.sh
